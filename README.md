# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, a constantly evolving set of configuration settings, contribute to a smoother command line experience (this at least is my intention :grin:).

I keep all of the files under version control by following __Nicola Paolucci__'s great guide ["The best way to store your dotfiles"](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

I am also intending to adapt my vim configuration to the modular approach [Chris Toomey](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) is using.

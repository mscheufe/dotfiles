# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, a constantly evolving set of configuration settings, contribute to a smoother command line experience. (this at least is the intention :grin: ).

I keep all of the files under version control by following the great guide [The best way to store your dotfiles](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) written by  __Nicola Paolucci__.

I am also intending to adapt my vim configuration to the modular approach of [Chris Toomey](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) is using.
